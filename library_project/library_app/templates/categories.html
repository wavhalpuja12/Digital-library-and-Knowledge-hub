      <h2>Literature</h2>
      <div class="book-count">5062 books in category</div>
      <p class="category-desc">
        Literature is a form of written or spoken expression that uses language creatively to present ideas, emotions,
        experiences, and stories. It includes various forms such as poetry, prose, drama, and essays. Literature
        reflects human life, culture, thoughts, and imagination, and helps readers understand different perspectives and
        values. It is not only used for entertainment but also for education and expressing feelings and ideas in an
        artistic way. Through literature, writers communicate their thoughts and readers gain knowledge, inspiration,
        and emotional connection. It is considered an important part of human culture and intellectual development.

      <h2>Poetry</h2>
      <div class="book-count">5062 books in category</div>
      <p class="category-desc">
        Poetry is a form in which a writer expresses emotions, ideas, experiences, or imagination through
        creative and rhythmic use of language. It is different from normal writing because it focuses more on feelings,
        beauty, and artistic expression rather than just providing information. Poetry often uses rhyme, rhythm, and
        figures of speech such as simile, metaphor, and personification to make the writing more expressive and
        meaningful. It helps the reader to imagine scenes, feel emotions, and understand the deeper meaning behind the
        words. Poetry can describe nature, love, life, happiness, sadness, or any human experience in a creative and
        powerful way. It is considered one of the oldest and most beautiful forms of literary expression.

      <h2>Crime and mystery</h2>
      <div class="book-count">5062 books in category</div>
      <p class="category-desc">
        Crime and mystery is a genre of literature that focuses on crimes, investigations, and the process of
        discovering the truth behind a mysterious event. It usually involves a crime such as murder, theft, or
        kidnapping, and a main character like a detective, police officer, or investigator who tries to solve the case.
        The story creates suspense, tension, and curiosity, making the reader interested in finding out what happened
        and who is responsible. Mystery literature often includes clues, secrets, and unexpected twists that keep the
        reader engaged until the final solution is revealed. This genre not only entertains readers but also challenges
        their thinking and reasoning skills as they try to solve the mystery along with the investigator.

      <h2>Science fiction and fantasy</h2>
      <div class="book-count">5062 books in category</div>
      <p class="category-desc">
        Science fiction and fantasy are genres of literature that deal with imaginative and unreal elements, but they
        are different in their focus and themes. Science fiction is based on advanced science, technology, space travel,
        time travel, robots, and futuristic concepts. It explores how science and technology may affect human life in
        the future. These stories often include spaceships, aliens, and scientific inventions, such as in The Time
        Machine. On the other hand, fantasy is based on magical and supernatural elements that do not exist in real
        life. It includes magic, witches, dragons, and imaginary worlds. Fantasy stories take readers into a magical
        world full of adventure and imagination, such as Harry Potter. Both science fiction and fantasy help readers
        escape from reality and explore creative and imaginative possibilities beyond the real world.

      <p class="category-desc">
        Adventure is a genre of literature that focuses on exciting journeys, dangerous situations, and exploration of
        new places. It usually involves a brave main character who faces challenges, risks, and unexpected events while
        traveling or trying to achieve a goal. Adventure stories often include elements such as treasure hunts, survival
        in difficult conditions, sea voyages, or exploration of unknown lands. These stories create excitement and
        curiosity, keeping the reader interested in what will happen next. Adventure literature also teaches courage,
        confidence, and problem-solving skills. Famous adventure stories include Treasure Island and Robinson Crusoe,

      <h2>Classics</h2>
      <div class="book-count">5062 books in category</div>
      <p class="category-desc">
        Classic literature refers to books and literary works that are considered important, valuable, and timeless.
        These works are called classics because they remain popular and meaningful even after many years and
        generations. Classic literature usually presents universal themes such as love, life, society, human nature, and
        moral values, which are relevant in every period. These stories help readers understand culture, history, and
        human behavior. The language and writing style in classic literature are often rich and artistic. Famous
        examples of classic literature include Pride and Prejudice and Great Expectations, which are still widely read
        and appreciated today. Classic literature plays an important role in improving knowledge, thinking, and
        understanding of life.
